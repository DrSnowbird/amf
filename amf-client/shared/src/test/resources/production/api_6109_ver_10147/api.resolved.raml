          Uploads an image provided as either an actual file, or as JSON.
          There are several options to provide an image as application/json, using different combinations of properties from the specified schema. As long as it is clear what the picture is you want to provide. E.g.
            - Just an @id with a readable location.
            - Or just the hash, if the picture is already known by the API.
            - Or just the contents, as a base64 encoded string.
          Images are positioned cq ordered by the order in which they were received, if a position is not specified.
